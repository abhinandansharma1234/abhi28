    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information.

    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "ALTER: This command is used to modify an existing database object, such as adding a new column to a table or changing the data type of a column. For example, to add a new column called \"address\" to the \"customers\" table, you could use the following SQL command:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all the data in a table, but it does not delete the table itself. For example, to delete all the data in the \"customers\" table without deleting the table itself, you could use the following SQL command:\n",

    "INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone) VALUES ('John Smith', 'john@example.com', '555-1234');\n",

    "Primary key and foreign key are both important concepts in relational database design. They are used to establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or combination of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key must be unique and not null for each row in the table. It is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record in the table can be uniquely identified. For example, a table called \"employees\" might have a primary key column called \"employee_id\" that is used to uniquely identify each employee record.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or combination of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables and ensure referential integrity. The foreign key in one table is usually a reference to the primary key in another table. For example, a table called \"orders\" might have a foreign key column called \"customer_id\" that refers to the primary key column \"customer_id\" in a table called \"customers\". This establishes a relationship between the \"orders\" and \"customers\" tables and ensures that only valid customer IDs are used in the \"orders\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a foreign key is defined, the database management system will ensure that only valid values are used for that key. This helps to prevent data inconsistencies and ensures that data is accurate and reliable. The use of primary and foreign keys is a key aspect of database design and is critical for building scalable and maintainable systems."
