    "We use the Exception class as a base class when creating a custom exception because it provides a well-defined interface and behavior that is expected of an exception in Python. By inheriting from the Exception class, our custom exception can take advantage of this pre-defined behavior, such as being able to raise and handle the exception in a consistent and predictable way. Additionally, by inheriting from the Exception class, our custom exception can be caught using a broader except clause that catches all exceptions, or a more specific clause that only catches our custom exception or its subclasses."

    "Always catch specific exceptions rather than catching all exceptions using a bare except clause.\n",

    "Be mindful of where you raise an exception, especially in a library, it may have unexpected effects on the caller's code.\n",
