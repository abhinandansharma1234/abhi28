    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It indicates a runtime error, such as division by zero, accessing an out-of-bounds list element, or using an undefined variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are errors in the syntax of the code, that is, the code does not conform to the rules of the Python language. These errors are detected before the code is executed, and the interpreter raises a SyntaxError. On the other hand, exceptions occur during the execution of the code, and they indicate a runtime error, such as a divide-by-zero error or an attempt to access a list element that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, it is possible to handle exceptions using try-except blocks. This allows you to catch exceptions and take appropriate action when they occur, instead of letting the program terminate with an error. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs."
